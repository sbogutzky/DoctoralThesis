abstract = {In this study we describe an ambulatory system for estimation of spatio-temporal parameters during long periods of walking. This original method based on wavelet analysis is proposed to compute the values of temporal gait parameters from the angular velocity of lower limbs. Based on a mechanical model, the medio-lateral rotation of the lower limbs during stance and swing, the stride length and velocity are estimated by integration of the angular velocity. Measurement's accuracy was assessed using as a criterion standard the information provided by foot pressure sensors. To assess the accuracy of the method on a broad range of performance for each gait parameter, we gathered data from young and elderly subjects. No significant error was observed for toe-off detection, while a slight systematic delay (10 ms on average) existed between heelstrike obtained from gyroscopes and footswitch. There was no significant difference between actual spatial parameters (stride length and velocity) and their estimated values. Errors for velocity and stride length estimations were 0.06 m/s and 0.07 m, respectively. This system is light, portable, inexpensive and does not provoke any discomfort to subjects. It can be carried for long periods of time, thus providing new longitudinal information such as stride-to-stride variability of gait. Several clinical applications can be proposed such as outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, gait analysis in neurological diseases, and fall risk estimation in elderly.},

Die Belastungen w{\"{a}}h- rend des Wettkampfes k{\"{o}}nnen dabei {\"{u}}ber kinematische Daten wie Laufwege und Geschwindigkeiten gemessen werden, denen man physiologische Beanspruchungen gegen{\"{u}}berstellt, um gegebenenfalls den Trainingsprozess des Spielers wettkampf- spezifisch optimieren zu k{\"{o}}nnen. Die Universit{\"{a}}t Paderborn (Heinz-Nixdorf -Institut) hat dazu ein physiologisches Spielbeobachtungssystem entwickelt, welches die synchrone Aufzeichnung von Videodaten und der Herzfrequenz erlaubt (Witkowski et al., 2008; Wilhelm et al., 2008). Dieses System macht es m{\"{o}}glich, detaillierte physische Anforderungsprofile hinsichtlich Spielsituationen und Spielpositionen zu erstellen. Zus{\"{a}}tzlich besteht die M{\"{o}}glichkeit, weitere physiologische Parame- ter zu integrieren, die z. B f{\"{u}}r psychisch-mentale Beanspruchungen im Sportspiel eine Rolle spielen k{\"{o}}nnten. Die Spieler sind bei der Aus{\"{u}}bung ihrer Sportart mit Druckbedingungen konfrontiert, die in hohem Ma{\ss}e mit Stress assoziiert sind und zu Leistungsbeeintr{\"{a}}chtigungen f{\"{u}}hren k{\"{o}}nnen.

Die tats{\"{a}}chliche Wiedergabe der Aktivit{\"{a}}t sympathischer Nervenfasern durch die gemessene EDA konnte erstmals mittels neurographischer Messungen von Lidberg und Wallin (1981) demonstriert werden.

This chapter defines the core concepts surrounding biofeedback and denotes their relations. Subsequently, a closed-loop human-machine architecture is introduced in which a biofeedback protocol is executed. This architecture is brought from theory to practice via a personalized affective music player (AMP). Regression and kernel density estimation are applied to model the physiological changes elicited by music. The AMP was validated via a real-world evaluation over the course of several weeks. Results show that our autonomous closed-loop biofeedback system can cope with noisy situations and handle large interindividual differences in the music domain. The AMP augments music listening, where its techniques enable autonomous affect guidance. Our approach provides valuable insights for affective computing and autonomous closed-loop biofeedback systems in general.},

abstract = {Expert performance is commonly accompanied by a subjective state of optimal experience called flow. Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.},

abstract = {It is the central hypothesis of this paper that the mental states commonly referred to as altered states of consciousness are principally due to transient prefrontal cortex deregulation. Supportive evidence from psychological and neuroscientific studies of dreaming, endurance running, meditation, daydreaming, hypnosis, and various drug-induced states is presented and integrated. It is proposed that transient hypofrontality is the unifying feature of all altered states and that the phenomenological uniqueness of each state is the result of the differential viability of various frontal circuits. Using an evolutionary approach, consciousness is conceptualized as hierarchically ordered cognitive function. Higher-order structures perform increasingly integrative functions and thus contribute more sophisticated content. Although this implies a holistic approach to consciousness, such a functional hierarchy localizes the most sophisticated layers of consciousness in the zenithal higher-order structure: the prefrontal cortex. The hallmark of altered states of consciousness is the subtle modification of behavioral and cognitive functions that are typically ascribed to the prefrontal cortex. The theoretical framework presented yields a number of testable hypotheses.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical work in cognitive science and neuroscience is brought into contact with the concept of the flow experience. After a brief exposition of brain function, the explicit-implicit distinction is applied to the effortless information processing that is so characteristic of the flow state. The explicit system is associated with the higher cognitive functions of the frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe structures and has evolved to increase cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the implicit system is associated with the skill-based knowledge supported primarily by the basal ganglia and has the advantage of being more efficient. From the analysis of this flexibility/efficiency trade-off emerges a thesis that identifies the flow state as a period during which a highly practiced skill that is represented in the implicit system's knowledge base is implemented without interference from the explicit system. It is proposed that a necessary prerequisite to the experience of flow is a state of transient hypofrontality that enables the temporary suppression of the analytical and meta-conscious capacities of the explicit system. Examining sensory-motor integration skills that seem to typify flow such as athletic performance, writing, and free-jazz improvisation, the new framework clarifies how this concept relates to creativity and opens new avenues of research.},

Results showed that during exercise performance on tests demanding prefrontal-dependent cognition was impaired, while at the same time, cognitive processes requiring little prefrontal activity were unaffected. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the feedback given is based on the runner's vertical displacement of the center of mass. As this is the main source of energy expenditure during running, it is conjectured that a reduced vertical displacement should improve running economy.},

For our study, we collected data from 40 runners who had a standard accelerometer in a custom-built sensor pod attached to the laces of their running shoes. The acceleration in three axes was recorded continuously while the runners conducted their runs. Data for repeated runs at two different speed levels were collected in order to have sufficient sensor data for classification. The data was analyzed using features computed for individual steps of the runners to distinguish the three foot strike pattern classes. The labels for the strike pattern classes were established using high-speed video that was concurrently collected. We could show that the classification of the strike types based on the measured accelerations and the extracted features was up to 95.3{\%} accurate. The established classification system can be used to support runners, for example by giving running shoe recommendations that ideally match the prevailing strike type of the runner.},

abstract = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

Although much research has examined the psychological features of flow, little is known about its biological underpinnings. The present study aimed at contributing to this gap by investigating the psychophysiological correlates of flow experience during daily routines. To this end, 15 university students took part in an experience sampling study, in which they provided real-time information on daily activities and associated experience while cardiac activity was monitored. After seven days of observation, 32 flow events were identified among 10 participants. A multilevel regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between optimal experience and specific cardiovascular indexes. In particular, the experience of flow was associated with increased heart rate and increased LF/HF ratio, suggesting relative sympathetic enhancement. These findings are in line with those obtained by previous related studies and indicate the feasibility of investigating physiological correlates of subjective experience in ecological contexts.},

abstract = {Inertial and magnetic sensors offers a sourceless and mobile option to obtain body posture and motion for personal sports or healthcare assistants, if sensors could be unobtrusively integrated in casual garments and accessories. We present in this paper design, implementation, and evaluation results for a novel miniature attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) named ETHOS using current off-the-shelf technologies. ETHOS has a unit size of 2.5cm3, which is substantially below most currently marketed attitude heading reference systems, while the unit contains processing resources to estimate its orientation online. Results on power consumption in relation to sampling frequency and sensor use are presented. Moreover two sensor fusion algorithms to estimate orientation: a quaternion-based Kalman-, and a complementary filter. Evaluations of orientation estimation accuracy in static and dynamic conditions revealed that complementary filtering reached sufficient accuracy while consuming 46{\%} of a Kalman's power. The system runtime of ETHOS was found to be 10 hours at a complementary filter update rate of 128Hz. Furthermore, we found that a ETHOS prototype functioned with a sufficient accuracy in estimating human movement in real-life conditions using an arm rehabilitation robot.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model which predicts both the major qualitative features and, within experimental error, the quantitative details of a class of perturbed and unperturbed large-amplitude, voluntary movements performed at intermediate speed by primates. A feature of the mathematical model is that a concise description of the behavioral organization of the movement has been formulated which is separate and distinct from the description of the dynamics of movement execution. Based on observations of voluntary movements in primates, the organization has been described as though the goal were to make the smoothest movement possible under the circumstances, i.e., to minimize the accelerative transients. This has been formalized by using dynamic optimization theory to determine the movement which minimizes the rate of change of acceleration (jerk) of the limb. Based on observations of muscle mechanics, the concept of a "virtual position" determined by the active states of the muscles is rigorously defined as one of the mechanical consequences of the neural commands to the muscles. This provides insight into the mechanics of perturbed and unperturbed movements and is a useful aid in the separation of the descriptions of movement organization and movement execution.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test a theoretical model (Stein et al. 1986) which suggested that minimizing the rate of metabolic energy consumption (VO2) is related to minimizing jerk (third derivative of position) during human movement. At a given speed of walking, VO2 has been shown to increase curvilinearly as stride length (SL) is varied from freely chosen stride length (FCSL). It was hypothesized that the jerk-cost, or JC (area under squared jerk curve), would exhibit similar behavior. Subjects (n = 24) walked (1.75 m.s-1) on a treadmill at FCSL, and at SL derivations at +/- 10 and +/- 20{\%} of leg length from FCSL until steady-state VO2 was attained. Videotaping (60 Hz) in the sagittal plane and subsequent digitizing of relevant markers produced position coordinates which were smoothed and normalized in both distance and time before calculating the third time derivative to obtain two-dimensional JC values. The expected response of VO2 to deviations in SL was found (minimum at FCSL), but JC increased with SL except at the two longest SL conditions. A weak but statistically significant negative correlation was found between VO2 and JC, suggesting that smoothness and economy are not complementary performance criteria during walking.},

abstract = {Many activities can create flow. In his in-depth analysis Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has found a number of factors common to activities creating flow, one being that a person's abilities optimally align with the challenges set by the task. This combined with other factors enables individuals to be so deeply absorbed in an activity that they do not only blend out their environment and their self but also lose all sense of time. There exist various methods to measure flow. The downside of existing procedures is, however, that they require an extensive range of equipment. Another disadvantage is that interviewing test subjects about their flow experience during the experiment naturally interrupts their flow.Within the framework of this research project a learning programme has been developed that allows its user to be in flow. While the user is in flow, a newly developed measurement method will record EEG signals that permit conclusions on the flow state without actually drawing the test subject out of it. This will then allow to empirically establish a causal link between flow and success in learning.},

The nine FSS scales of the 36-item instrument represent the dimensions of flow discussed by Csikszentmihalyi (1990, 1993), and each scale is measured by four items. Development of items was based on (a) past research with flow state both within and outside of sport settings, (b) qualitative analysis of interviews with elite athletes, and (c) quantitative analyses conducted in the present investigation. Internal consistency estimates for the nine FSS scales were reasonable (alpha M = 33) for administration of the scale to 394 athletes. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the nine scales. Consistent with the theoretical basis of the FSS, there was also support for a hierarchical model in which one global (higher order) flow factor explained correlations among the nine first-order FSS factors.

Together, the scales provide options for assessing flow in different contexts and when different goals or constraints are operating.

abstract = {Dynamic heart rate control by parasympathetic nervous input involves feedback mechanisms and reflex bursting of efferent cardiac vagal fibers. Periodic vagal bursting induces phasic changes in sinoatrial cycle length and can entrain the pacemaker to beat at periods that may be identical to those of the vagal burst. We investigated the electrophysiological basis of these phenomena in isolated sinus node preparations (rabbit, cat, and sheep). In the presence of propranolol (3.9 X 10(-6)M), relatively brief (50-150 msec) trains of stimuli, applied onto the endocardial surface of the preparation, activated postganglionic vagal terminals and induced a brief hyperpolarization of sinoatrial pacemaker cells. This vagally mediated hyperpolarization could alter the pacemaker rhythm by an amount that depended on its duration and its position in the cycle, as well as on the duration of the free-running pacemaker period. When the free-running period was sufficiently long and the hyperpolarization was induced sufficiently early in the spontaneous cycle, a "paradoxical" acceleration of the pacemaker rhythm ensued. Phasic changes were plotted on phase-response curves, constructed by scanning systematically the sinoatrial pacemaker period with single or repetitive vagal trains. These phase-response curves enabled us to predict the entrainment characteristics and the levels of synchronization of the pacemaker to the vagal periodicity. The overall data explain the cellular mechanisms involved in the phasic effects of brief vagal discharges on sinoatrial periodicity, and provide conclusive evidence for the prediction that repetitive vagal input is capable of forcing the cardiac pacemaker to beat at rates that can be faster or slower than the intrinsic pacemaker rate. These data should improve our knowledge of the dynamic control of heart rate by neural reflexes and aid in our understanding of rhythm disturbances generated by the interaction of the cardiac pacemaker with vagal activity.},

Based on this investigation, we present a design space for run-training technologies. By plotting existing technologies onto the design space, we argue that there has been limited attention on how to utilize technique- related information in run-training interfaces. From that finding, this paper presents three questions to be addressed by designers of future run-training interfaces. We believe that addressing these questions will support creation of expedient interfaces that improve runners' technique and training.},

Two studies are reported that investigate the consequences of compatibility of skills and task demands during task engagement. Departing from correlational research, the present studies employ a newly developed experimental paradigm to document the causal impact of such a skills/demands compatibility on the emergence of flow.

abstract = {This study explored the possibilities the psychophysiological methodology offer to flow research. Facial electromyography has often been used to index valence, and electrodermal activity to index arousal, the two basic dimensions of emotion. It was hypothesized that these measures can also be used to examine enjoyment, a basic component of flow experiment. A digital game was used to induce flow, and physiological activity of 32 subjects was measured continuously. Flow State Scale was used to assess flow. Activity of corrugator supercilii muscle, an index of negative valence, was negatively correlated with flow reports, as hypothesized. Contrary to hypothesis, skin conductance level, an index of arousal, was unrelated to self-reported flow. The results for association between flow and zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi muscle activities, indices of positive valence, were inconclusive, possibly due to experimental design where only tonic measures were available. Psychophysiological methods are recommended for future studies of flow. Specifically, the time series approach may be particularly viable in examining the temporal aspects of flow, an area currently unexplored. Furthermore, it is suggested that digital game research would benefit from psychophysiological study of game-related flow.

Furthermore, to be practical, the algorithm has been developed to ensure the robustness of detection (i.e., without missing the gait events in various speed conditions).

abstract = {This paper presents a novel orientation algorithm designed to support a computationally efficient, wearable inertial human motion tracking system for rehabilitation applications. It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless} 0.8° static RMS error, {\textless} 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

abstract = {We investigate the phase synchronization of heartbeat and respiration in a group of healthy infants. Having presented and compared two quantitative measures of synchronization, we conclude that one of these measures — the conditional probability index — allows reliable detection of synchronous epochs of different order n:m and, thus, makes possible an automatic processing of large data sets. In our analysis of experimental time series, we have found numerous epochs of phase synchronization. It turned out that the average degree of synchronization varies with the age of the newborns.

abstract = {This paper presents some elementary principles regarding constraints on movements, which may be useful in modeling and interpreting motor control strategies for skilled movements. Movements which are optimum with respect to various objectives, or "costs", are analyzed and compared. The specific costs considered are related to movement time, distance, peak velocity, energy, peak acceleration, and rate of change of acceleration (jerk). The velocity patterns for the various minimum cost movements are compared with each other and with some skilled movement patterns. The concept of performance trade-offs between competing objectives is used to interpret the distance-time relationships observed in skilled movements. Examples of arm movements during violin bowing and jaw movements during speech are used to show how skilled movements are influenced by considerations of physical economy, or "ease", of movement. Minimum-cost solutions for the various costs, which include the effect of frictional forces, are given in Appendices.},

abstract = {The synchronization of cardiac and locomotor rhythms has been suggested to enhance the efficiency of arterial delivery to active muscles during rhythmic exercise, but direct evidence showing such a functional role has not been provided. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the heartbeat is coupled with intramuscular pressure (IMP) changes so as to time the delivery of blood through peripheral tissues when the IMP is lower. To this end, we developed a computer-controlled, dynamic, thigh cuff occlusion device that enables bilateral thigh cuffs to repeatedly inflate and deflate, one side after the other, to simulate rhythmic IMP changes during bipedal locomotion. Nine healthy subjects were examined, and three different occlusion pressures (50, 80, and 120 mmHg) were applied separately to the thigh cuffs of normal subjects while they were sitting. Alternate occlusions of the bilateral thigh cuffs administered at the frequency of the mean heart rate produced significant phase synchronization between the cardiac and cuff-occlusion rhythms when 120 mmHg pressure was applied. However, synchronization was not observed when the occlusion pressure was 50 or 80 mmHg. During synchronization, heartbeats were most likely to occur in phases that did not include overlap between the peak arterial flow velocity in the thigh and elevated cuff pressure. We believe that phase synchronization occurs so that the cardiac cycle is timed to deliver blood through the lower legs when IMP is not maximal. If this can be extrapolated to natural locomotion, synchronization between cardiac and locomotor activities may be associated with the improved perfusion of exercising muscles.},

Whereas recent studies suggest a positive relation between flow and physiological arousal, so far nothing is known on the relation between flow and high arousal in response to a salient stressor. We here suggest that the relation of flow with sympathetic arousal and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation follows an inverted u-curve rather than a linear function: moderate physiological arousal should facilitate flow-experience, whereas excessive physiological arousal should hinder flow. In order to experimentally stimulate high physiological arousal, we exposed 22 healthy male participants to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test. Then, participants had to perform a complex computer task for 60minutes and to rate their flow-experience on the Flow Short-Scale directly after task completion. During the experiment, cortisol samples were taken every 15minutes, and heart rate variability measures were assessed by continuous electrocardiography. We found an inverted u-shaped relationship of flow-experience with indices of sympathetic arousal and cortisol, whereas parasympathetic indices of heart rate control during stress were linearly and positively correlated with flow-experience. Our results suggest that moderate sympathetic arousal and HPA-axis activation and possibly a co-activation of both branches of the autonomic nervous system characterize task-related flow-experience.},

abstract = {Cardiolocomotor synchronization (CLS) has been well established for individuals engaged in rhythmic activity, such as walking, running, or cycling. When frequency of the activity is at or near the heart rate, entrainment occurs. CLS has been shown in many cases to improve the efficiency of locomotor activity, improving stroke volume, reducing blood pressure variability, and lowering the oxygen uptake (VO2). Instead of a 1:1 frequency ratio of activity to heart rate, an investigation was performed to determine if different harmonic coupling at other simple integer ratios (e.g. 1:2, 2:3, 3:2) could achieve any performance benefits. CLS was ensured by pacing the stride rate according to the measured heartbeat (i.e., adaptive paced CLS, or forced CLS). An algorithm was designed that determined the simplest ratio (lowest denominator) that, when multiplied by the heart rate will fall within an individualized, predetermined comfortable pacing range for the user. The algorithm was implemented on an iPhone 4, which generated a 'tick-tock' sound through the iPhone's headphones. A sham-controlled crossover study was performed with 15 volunteers of various fitness levels. Subjects ran a 3 mile (4.83 km) simulated training run at their normal pace on two consecutive days (randomized one adaptive pacing, one sham). Adaptive pacing resulted in faster runs run times, with subjects running an average of 26:03 ± 3:23 for adaptive pacing and 26:38 ± 3:31 for sham (F = 5.46, p {\textless} 0.05). The increase in heart rate from the start of the race as estimated by an exponential time constant was significantly longer during adaptive pacing, $\tau$ = 0.99 ± 0.30, compared to sham, $\tau$ = 1.53 ± 0.34 (t = -6.62, p {\textless} 0.01). Eighty-seven percent of runners found it easy to adjust their stride length to match the pacing signal with seventy-nine percent reporting that pacing helped their performance. These results suggest that adaptive paced CLS may have a beneficial effect on running performance and may be useful as a training aid. Key PointsSham-controlled crossover study using 15 experienced runners running 3 miles (4.83 km).Adaptive CLS pacing resulted in statistically significant 35 second average decrease in run-time (p {\textless} 0.05).Increase in heart rate during the run was significantly slower during adaptive pacing (p {\textless} 0.01).},

A model is described that emphasizes the role of the parasympathetic nervous system and particularly the vagus nerve in defining stress. The model details the importance of a branch of the vagus originating in the nucleus ambiguus. In mammals the nucleus ambiguus not only coordinates sucking, swallowing, and breathing, but it also regulates heart rate and vocalizations in response to stressors. In mammals it is possible, by quantifying the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, to assess the tonic and phasic regulation of the vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus. Measurement of this component of vagal tone is proposed as a method to assess, on an individual basis, both stress and the vulnerability to stress.},

The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone, two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since research software for smartphones have been published in open source, which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their utilization in research.},

abstract = {Objectives: This research aimed to shed light on the relationship between flow experience and perfor- mance in sports using a marathon race as an example. We hypothesized that flow influences the marathon race performance by an indirect rewarding effect. We assumed that the positive quality of flow experience rewards the pre-race running activity and thereby enhances training behavior which again leads to high race performance. A methodological issue of the this was to compare the retrospective with the experience-sampling measure of flow. Design: Three studies with marathon runners (Ns 1⁄4 109, 112, 65 for Studies 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were conducted. Method: They measured flow experience four times during a marathon race either retrospectively (Studies 1 and 2) or using an experience-sampling method during the race (Study 3). Additionally race performance and future running motivation (Studies 1, 2, and 3), pre-race training behavior (Studies 2 and 3) and flow experience in training (Study 3) were measured. Results: The results confirmed the hypothesis showing that flow during a marathon race is related to future running motivation, but is not directly linked to race performance. Instead, race performance was predicted by pre-race training behavior (Studies 2 and 3) which again was fostered by flow during the training (Study 3). The descriptive flow courses of the retrospective and the experience-sampling flow measures were comparable but also showed important differences. Conclusions: We critically discuss the practical implications of the rewarding effect of flow on perfor- mance and the advantages of the retrospective and experience-sampling measure of flow.},

Ausgehend vom Flow-Konzept Csikszentmihalyis (1992, 2004) und Forschungsberichten zum Flow-Erleben, stellt der Beitrag zwei Studien vor, die Flow-Erfahrungen von Marathonläufern (N = 234) dokumentieren und analysieren. Als Messinstrument diente die Flow-Kurzskala von Rheinberg, Vollmeyer und Engeser (2003). Auf der Basis der Selbstberichte der Läufer zum Flow-Erleben (Flow-Generalfaktor) und zu ihrer subjektiven Anforderungs-Fähigkeits-Passung sowie den erfassten Laufzeiten werden in den statistischen Analysen folgende Fragestellungen überprüft: 1.) Stellt die Anforderungs-Fähigkeits-Passung eine Voraussetzung für Flow-Erfahrungen dar? und 2.) Steht Flow im Zusammenhang mit den Laufleistungen? Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Passung nicht zwingend als Voraussetzung für Flow-Erfahrungen angesehen werden muss und ein Flow-Leistungs-Zusammenhang für Marathonläufer der mittleren Leistungsfähigkeit (3 bis 4 Stunden Laufzeit) nicht existiert. Im Resümee werden Schlussfolgerungen für die weitere Flow-Forschung im Sport gezogen.},

abstract = {Injuries in running are often provoked by fatigue or improper technique, which are both reflected in the runner's kinemat- ics. State of the art research on kinematics in sports is us- ing optical motion capture systems that are inaccessible to most athletes. This paper demonstrates the potential of wear- able sensors for runners' kinematics analysis. We present a user study including 21 subjects of different running experi- ence that performed an exhausting run on a conventional out- side track wearing ETHOS units. For performance level as- sessment, training assistance, and fatigue monitoring we ex- tracted the foot contact duration, the foot strike type, and the heel lift as kinematic parameters. A questionnaire revealed that subjects perceived the sensors as comfortable to wear and would use them on a regular basis. We concluded that wearable sensors provide a valuable tool for runners, from beginners to experts, for running technique assessment.},

abstract = {Kubios HRV is an advanced and easy to use software for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The software supports several input data formats for electrocardiogram (ECG) data and beat-to-beat RR interval data. It includes an adaptive QRS detection algorithm and tools for artifact correction, trend removal and analysis sample selection. The software computes all the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters and several nonlinear parameters. There are several adjustable analysis settings through which the analysis methods can be optimized for different data. The ECG derived respiratory frequency is also computed, which is important for reliable interpretation of the analysis results. The analysis results can be saved as an ASCII text file (easy to import into MS Excel or SPSS), Matlab MAT-file, or as a PDF report. The software is easy to use through its compact graphical user interface. The software is available free of charge for Windows and Linux operating systems at http://kubios.uef.fi.},

abstract = {We present the results of an experimental investigation on the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and flow in adults exposed to computer-simulated tasks with different demand level manipula- tions: a balanced skill-demand level (fit) to induce flow, too high demands to induce anxiety, and too low demands to induce boredom. Eighteen participants were exposed to three simulated driving tasks that differed in their demand levels. During all tasks, the participants' heart rates were monitored and flow was measured after each task by means of a questionnaire. Our results show that high-frequency HRV (HF-HRV) and low-frequency HRV (LF-HRV) differed between the three experimental conditions and an increase in demand level caused a decrease in HF-HRV and LF-HRV. Furthermore, experiencing flow in a balanced skill-demand task was associated with a decreased LFHRV activity compared to being engaged in a task with too high demands (anxiety condition), in which higher levels of flow were related to moderate parasympathetic activity (HF-HRV) as well as to moderate baroreflex function (LF-HRV). Our results contribute to a better understanding of the psychophysiology of flow and further demonstrate how virtual environments such a driving simulator can be effectively used to investigate psychological constructs such as flow or anxiety.},

Studies comparing earPod with an iPod-like vis- ual menu technique on reasonably-sized static menus indi- cate that they are comparable in accuracy. In terms of effi- ciency (speed), earPod is initially slower, but outperforms the visual technique within 30 minutes of practice. Our re- sults indicate that earPod is potentially a reasonable eyes- free menu technique for general use, and is a particularly exciting technique for use in mobile device interfaces.},
